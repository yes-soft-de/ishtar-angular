  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <p>In syria, the scribes discovered in the city of Ugarit was the first alphabet in history. We have a proud tradition
    of oral and written poetry and we shouldn’t forget several singing traditional types like muwashahat. Regardless all
    these masterpieces our architectural style is fascinating. Our handmade furniture with mosaic patterns are a true
    evidence of creativity. It’s sold all around the world.
    All what we said is just a tiny glance of what syrian people really are.
