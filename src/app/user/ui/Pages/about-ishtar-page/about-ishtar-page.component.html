                <p>
                    Ishtar is the East Semitic Akkadian, Assyrian and Babylonian goddess of fertility, love, war, and sex. She is the counterpart to the Sumerian Inanna, and is the cognate for the Northwest Semitic Aramean goddess Astarte.

                        <h3>The main idea</h3>
                        <p>
                            In the beginning we had the idea of combining two different propositions. The first is that the site of Ishtar is mainly concerned with art and the universal paintings.
                            <br> 
                            The other suggestion is the meaning and the mythology of Ishtar as a goddess of the ancient Babylonians and a civilization of its own.

                            At the beginning of the drawing of the letter i, we have to include the element of creativity on the one hand and as we mentioned earlier the architectural style on the other hand and therefore the drawing was similar to the column used in construction in the time of Babylonian civilization.

                            To design the letter H in its current form it was necessary to focus on showing the historical aspect of the hand and the letter H on the other hand, so the column was copied as stated in the letter I and also added an element which makes the design finally highlights the aesthetic character H and the same Time The historical gate of Ishtar, which is one of the main gates in the city of Babylon, appears.

                            The first phase of the work was completed on the logo in the same manner, thus producing our Ishtar logo in total and away from the details in addition to the use of gray, which is one of the gradations of black color in the composition of the first structure of the logo.

                            In order to add attractive color as a background within the logo itself we had to use a distinctive color capable of absorbing the rest of the colors and on the other hand, it is possible to identify the basic template of the logo and detect the errors in it and therefore was directed to black color with a dark degree.

Therefore, we intended to associate the female face representing the gods Ishtar with the letter R in order to show the reader the correct history of the beginning of the Babylonian civilization.
